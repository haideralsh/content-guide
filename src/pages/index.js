            tools and guidance necessary to approach writing copy in a

            This guide addresses how to write in Nulogyâ€™s voice, how to identify
            the proper tone for a given situation, the grammar rules we adhere
            to, and best practices for writing for translation and
            accessibility. When applied across our organization, this will
            improve the experiences of our customers on a global platform.
