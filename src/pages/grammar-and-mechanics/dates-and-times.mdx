# Dates and times

## Dates
Formatting dates and times can be tricky because the standards differ from country to country. Nulogy is a company that services customers from around the world, so we need to ensure that the dates we list in our softwares are consistent and recognizable.

The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) states that the international standard is YYYY-MM-DD. This standard is not adopted in every single country around the world, but it does offer us the safest route to ensure that the dates listed in our applications are easy to read.

Given that the ISO date format is not fully adopted worldwide, Nulogy goes a step further to ensure that dates are understandable with no margin for misinterpretation. In order to avoid users confusing the two digits that represent the month and the two digits to represent the day, we represent the month in their MLA abbreviated form:

<Flex justifyContent="space-between" maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH} m="0 auto" mb="x4">
  <Box>
    <Text>
      <strong>January</strong> - Jan
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>February</strong> - Feb
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>March</strong> - Mar
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Text>
      <strong>April</strong> - Apr
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>May</strong> - May
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>June</strong> - June
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Text>
      <strong>July</strong> - July
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>August</strong> - Aug
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>September</strong> - Sept
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Text>
      <strong>October</strong> - Oct
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>November</strong> - Nov
    </Text>
    <Text>
      <strong>December</strong> - Dec
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Flex>

For example, November 4th, 2021 would read as 2021-Nov-04. July 28th, 2025 would read as 2025-Jul-28. 

<Flex justifyContent="space-between" maxWidth={COPY_WIDTH} m="0 auto" mb="x4">
  <Box>
    <Text>
      <NoExample>2023-06-03</NoExample>
    </Text>
    <Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <Text>
      <YesExample>2023-June-03</YesExample>
    </Text>
  </Box>
  <Box>
</Flex>

Dates appearing in a sentence are one of two exceptions to this formatting rule. They are written out in full to ensure our overall voice remains professional and understandable. Month abbreviations are not used.
