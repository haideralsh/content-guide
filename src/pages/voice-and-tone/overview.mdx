# Voice and tone

To begin, what is the difference between voice and tone?

As individuals, we all have a unique voice. Yes, we all sound different and have unique voice signatures, but a written word doesn’t sound one way or another, does it?

When we refer to the voice of a writing style, we mean the perceived perspective of the text. It is the ways in which we can imbue an author with personality. The ways in which their writing style tells us who they are and what are their values. Voice is constant.

Tone, on the other hand, constantly changes. Tone reflects the intention or emotion of the circumstance. For example, Nulogy’s tone will be different if we celebrate a success, or help a user troubleshoot an error.
